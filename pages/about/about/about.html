  <p>
    Chef's Assistant is a hands-free cooking application that focuses on the users. Not only focused on being extremely
    user-friendly,it also allows for a lot of user personalization. We know that constantly referring back to a recipe book or
    website can be extremely tedious and messy when you are hard at work in the kitched. That is why we implemented a talk functionn
    that allows users to navigate through the site all through voice! Users can search for recipes, add grocery items to their shopping
    list, update the items in their fridge, plan their meals ahead of time, and add recipes to their favorites all either through
    manual input or speech. Chef's Assistant is your one and only needed assistant when you cook!
